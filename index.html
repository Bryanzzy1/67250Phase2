                Take a step back in time on a century-old cable car and see the best
                views of downtown Pittsburgh while riding one of the few remaining
                inclines in the country. Opened on May 20, 1877, the Duquesne Incline
                was rescued and restored by a group of local residents in 1963 and
                still delights residents and visitors with its original, elegant,
                wooden cable cars. Now you can visit the interior of the incline and
                watch the machinery while it operates. The Duquesne Incline's upper
                station houses a museum of Pittsburgh history, including photos and a
                storehouse of information on inclines from around the world. Unusual
                Pittsburgh souvenirs, maps and photos can be found at the gift shop.

                Exact Cash Fare upon arrival. There are no tickets, no advance
                payment, no reservations and no debit or credit cards.<br><br>The
                Duquesne Incline is part of the transportation system in Pittsburgh
                and therefore uses the same _CASH_ fare system as the buses and
                trolleys. A change machine is available for your convenience. Having
                the exact fare in hand speeds up the payment process
                considerably.<br><br>Pennsylvania Seniors 65 and older who
                present a BLUE or YELLOW PRT card or a Senior ConnectCard ride free,
                otherwise, the adult rate applies.The Duquesne Incline is required
                to request a Pennsylvania Senior Citizen Transit ID card as proof of
                discount eligiblity, no exceptions, in order to be reimbursed by the
                Commonwealth of PA.<br><br>Sorry, no rest rooms. The Duquesne
                Incline has been part of Pittsburgh's transportation system since
                1877 like a trolley or the cable cars of San Francisco.<br><br>
                Saturday's and Sunday's after noon are our busiest times. Expect to wait in
                line for about 10 minutes in both directions.<br><br>There are
                many steps to traverse from the lower station parking lot. The Upper
                Station located at 1220 Grandview Ave, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15211 is
