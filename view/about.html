                        <h3>Early History</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Duquesne Incline is one of those which follows very
                            closely the tracks of an early coal hoist. Old newspapers
                            indicate the existence of such a conveyance as early as 1854.
                            Residents apparently referred to it as "Kirk Lewis' incline"
                            and located it on the present site of The Duquesne Incline's
                            Upper Station. Grandview Avenue was then the High Street, and
                            the area was just beginning to be converted from farmland to
                            homesites. This pleasantly-situated acreage was an excellent
                            area to absorb some of the expanding population of the city,
                            but the problem of easy access was still to be solved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although plans for a freight and passenger incline are known
                            to have existed much earlier, financial backing was
                            exceedingly hard to find--even the modest sum of $47,000--and
                            actual construction was delayed. Eventually, of course,
                            difficulties were overcome and the Incline was built. It was
                            opened to the public May 20, 1877. The Duquesne Incline was
                            the first Pittsburgh incline designed and built by Samuel
                            Diescher, for Kirk Bigham and Associates. Mr. Diescher, an
                            engineer, had become the country's foremost builder of
                            inclines. He was also to design and build most of those that
                            followed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the time of its public opening, it was one of four inclined
                            planes serving the summit of Coal Hill, which later came to be
                            known as Mount Washington. The Duquesne Incline was operated,
                            from 1877 until 1962 by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company.
                            From 1964 until the present, the Incline has been operated by
                            the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights
                            Incline; it has been owned by the Port Authority of Allegheny
                            County.

                                Incline was formed in 1964 by the Duquesne Heights/Mount
                                Washington neighborhood group that had rescued, repaired, and
                                reopened the Incline in 1963. The purpose was to continue to
                                restore and rehabilitate the cars, equipment, and both
                                stations, and to establish the entire operation as a reliable
                                commuter facility and a popular visitor attraction.
                                Memberships in the society are available, call for details.
